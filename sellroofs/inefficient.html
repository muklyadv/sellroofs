        <h1 style="margin: 2em 0 -0.3em 0;">Inefficiencies In Existing Sales Processes</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here is what your competition and marketers are doing and why it is not efficient.</strong></p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 5em ;">Door to door sales</h2>
        <p>This is what I would recommend to someone starting out, but it is not an efficient way to scale the business into a revenue-generating machine.</p>
        <p>I don’t find it time, effort or capital efficient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Too much management is needed</li>
            <li>Too much time wasted on inefficient ways of training people</li>
            <li>Roo much energy wasted on training because of many quitters and non-performers</li>
            <li>Lots of knocking to get very few customers</li>
            <li>Nothing new, just brute forcing your way on people's roofs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #6aa84f; margin-top: 3em;"> <strong>Every homeowner gets their door knocked and offers pitched in the same way by different roofers. <br>It’s just brute force and brute force is the most inefficient way to achieve anything.</strong></p>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top: 5em ;">Listing Websites</h2>
        <p>You get non exclusive REAL expensive leads that never convert into customers. Here are some customer reviews,</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #6aa84f; margin-top: 3em;"><strong>Closest to throwing money in fire.</strong></p>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top: 5em ;">Social Media Marketing and Content Creation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Big players are willing to pay more to get results.</li>
            <li>Tech companies are charging more money</li>
            <li>Everything is regulated</li>
            <li>Throwing money is required to get organic engagement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although one should invest time to build an image, relying on this method to scale your business is unpredictable and unreliable. Content creation works well as a support role for your paid ads.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #6aa84f; margin-top: 3em;"><strong>Even with a great strategy, content creation takes years before giving any return.</strong></p>
        <h2>Lead Generation and Appointment Setting</h2>
        <p>Everyone is running similar Facebook ads to get contact information of homeowners which they will then hammer using the sales staff till they give a date and time for an onsite inspection.</p>
        <ul style="text-align: center; list-style: none;">
            <h3>Because of this,</h3>
            <h3>Homeowners go with the cheapest option</h3>
            <h3>Which makes this as bad as Listing Sites</h3>
        </ul>
        <p>Agency owners and marketer are busy getting as many leads as they can. They are not concerned responsible for the number of customers the leads convert into.</p>

        <p>This arrangement of outsourcing the leads and making the in-house team hammer them degrades sales efficiency because the agency has your sales staff to blame for not getting enough sales and your sales staff has the agency to blame.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #6aa84f; margin: 3em 18% 0 18%;"><strong>For a successful sales process, one person should be responsible for the success of the entire project, not someone who focuses on a small part of it and skews results in their favor.</strong></p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why these methods did not work, In a nutshell.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scaling your business by leveraging D2D teams has an upper limit. Trying to ascend the cap results in acquisition turning non profitable.</li>
            <li>Buying Leads from listings is straight up a “throwing money in fire” service because of the price and the leads not being non exclusive or even worse, not even being an homeowner.</li>
            <li>Marketers or agencies, very rarely (almost never), deliver on the metric they guarantee. They manipulate and degrade result in their favor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>FROM THIS MARKET RESEARCH WE CONCLUDED THAT</p>
        <p>Roofers are <strong>not updating with time</strong> and are <strong>getting cheated on</strong> by marketers, agencies and listing sites, </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is what an ideal sales process should look like</p>
        <p>DESCRIPTION OF AN IDEAL ROOFING SALES OPERATION</p>
        <ol>
        <li>No sales bottlenecks, Super scaleable, will not run into any cap</li>
        <li>3.	No management problems.
            Easy to manage, this is very important because management also affects scalability.</li>
        <li>4.	Not getting cheated on by marketers, agencies or listing sites.

            [instead of putting accountability on them, you are not putting anything on them. The same process that keeps your inhouse team in check will be used to keep check on the marketer or the lead guy]
